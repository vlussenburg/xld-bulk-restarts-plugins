# xld-bulk-restarts-plugin

## Usage
After installation you will be able to right click on any Folder and execute this Control Task. It will find any Tomcat Server (tomcat.Server type) in the subdirectories under it and invoke the 'stop' on them. After all the stop jobs completed (or failed), it will execute the 'start' control tasks on them. 

### Example output
